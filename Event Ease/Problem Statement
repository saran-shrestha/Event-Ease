Problem Statement:
Existing event booking apps and platforms have failed to fully meet the needs and requirements of users looking
to discover and book events. Specifically, previous solutions have had the following limitations:
  	Fragmented event listings across multiple platforms make it difficult to find all relevant events in one place.
  	Minimal personalization in recommending events matched to a user's unique interests and preferences.
  	Complicated multi-step booking flows with manual form filling make ticket purchasing a hassle.
  	No effective way for event organizers to reach targeted audiences interested in their events.
  	Absence of social features for attendees to share event experiences and recommendations.
In summary, current apps fail to deliver the seamless discovery, personalized recommendations, smooth booking,
organizer reach, and social features that users expect.
